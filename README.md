## Contributing

- Follow the format of the pages in this repo. See `Elixir` for an example.
  - `- [Project Name](Project Link) - Short Project Description`
- Each list should cover several different types of projects. 
  - The goal being that if you were not familiar with the language and you read the list, you would easily be able to choose libraries for your project.
  - Examples: Web Framework, ORM, Caching, Message Processing, HTTP Client, Job Processing, DateTime manipulation
  - Limit to one project of each type in a list (1 web framework, 1 ORM, etc).
- Each project should be the best of it's type. This is somewhat subjective but could mean easiest to use, most feature rich, most popular, defacto choice, etc..
- Projects must be ordered alphabetically.
- Each list should be 10-20 projects.
- Fork this project and submit PRs.
- Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) messages
  - `feat: adding javascript support`
  - `fix: updating javascript ORM library`
